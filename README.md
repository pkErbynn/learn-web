# Learn Web : Building Backend of Web Application with Java from scratch.

In this tutorial we will explore building backend of a Web Application with Java. This includes version control(Git & GitHub), databases, APIs(using Spring Boot).

Have you learnt the basics of programming(with Java, C#)?  Not sure where to go next?  This workshop should be able to help with that.  

In this workshop we start from nothing and incrementally build up backend and then publish to Heroku server.
The tutorial is a mixture of mini comprehensive presentation sessions(...to explain theoretical concepts), sample codes and hands on lab exercises.

#### Prerequisites
- 
- A passion for wanting to learn how to build Web Applications.
